PLACEHOLDER FOR NOW, CURRENTLY BUSY REFACTORING libs16.py

Common code in Java for `c3ds-projects` projects.

This will eventually cover code that doesn't make sense outside of Creatures tooling.

In particular this will be where the PRAY encoding/decoding goes from Natsue, along with possible ✨️future stuff✨️

(In particular, a planned Java implementation of `libs16.py` is intended to go here!)
