====== Moniker ======

A moniker is made up of a generation number, a 4-letter word (chosen from various pools), and then 4 5-letter chunks.
These components are all separated by the - character.

An example: 001-dusk-yky4f-z6h5m-a3stm-pnuex.

The generation number can be reasonably assumed to go up to 2147483647.

Allowed characters are a-z, '-' and 0-9.

The minimum length for a standard creature moniker is thus 32 - 3 generation number digits, 4 word letters, 20 main digits, 5 separators.
The maximum length for a standard creature moniker is assumed to be 39.
