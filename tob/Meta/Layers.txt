====== Layers ======

Before going into this, it's worth noting that it seems different formats are used for the sending and receiving paths, though they go through the same classes.

From "send/recv calls at system level" outwards.

* [[:Structs:CBabelAsyncCore|CBabelAsyncCore]] pokes send/recv.
* [[:Structs:CBabelDConnection|CBabelDConnection]] handles the higher-level framing, and in particular appears to receive C_TID_BASE packets.
	* These packets can be MessageDispatch packets, and thus [[:Structs:CBabelMessage|CBabelMessage]] shows up.
	* Note however that data is //sent// via CBabelDConnection essentially directly.
* [[:Structs:CBabelClient|CBabelClient]] //usually// uses SendMessageA to send raw bytes.
	* This is used in 5 places, with the given formats:
		* WWR Packet
			* AddWWREntry
			* RemoveWWREntry
			* NotifyListeningPort
			* SendBinaryMessage
		* VSC Packet
			* [[:Structs:CBabelVirtualSocket|CBabelVirtualSocket]]::Connect(B_UIN *)
	* But then it wraps that with SendBinaryMessage.
	* There is also Connectx, which is wrapped by Connect - Connectx lets you supply an arbitrary handshake packet, while Connect generates the Docking Station login packet
		* The received packet is always 0x0A (C_TID_HANDSHAKE_RESPONSE)
		* The sent packet in practice is 0x25 (C_TID_HANDSHAKE)
	* The socket is written to by [[:Structs:CBabelVirtualSocket|CBabelVirtualSocket]]::Connect(B_UIN *) directly
	* GetClientInfo writes to the socket as well.
* Atop the Babel layer is the NetManager/C2E layer.
	* Worth noting is that while there appears to be some encryption involved for some high-level packets, it //may not be relevant to a Babel server.//
