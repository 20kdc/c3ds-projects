====== Formatting Guide ======

VTables are called vtbl always, and have their own struct definitions.

~~Use codeblocks for lists of fields~~, and use the following style:

* +4: Amounts of space octopi fought today.
	* int spaceOctopiFought

Ideally use links when other pages are involved.

===== For C_TID_BASE subclasses =====

* Name is a guess
* Transactional
