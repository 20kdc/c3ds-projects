# Configuration
server.cfg contains details of how to connect to the server.


* "Override Server" / "Override Port": Server details that take priority over others.
* "Server Count": Amount of servers in the configuration file.
	* "Server 0 FriendlyName": Server's friendly name.
	* "Server 0 Host": Server's hostname.
	* "Server 0 ID": The fancy server ID number.
	* "Server 0 Port": TCP port, usually 49152.


If no server information is available, the game defaults to a single server: heart.creatures.net, friendly name "Heart", ID 1, port 49152.
The domain is presently owned by NameFind LLC, whose description of themselves basically amounts to "we buy all the good names so we can sell them back to you".
