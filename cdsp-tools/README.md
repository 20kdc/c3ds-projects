cdsp-tools is a miscellaneous assortment of GUI (and maybe CLI at some point) tools. It is where stuff goes which ought to have a GUI, but really ought not to add yet another thing to build into releases.

Current features include:

* Can inject `.creature` and `.gen` files as eggs
* (Incomplete) genome viewer
* Norn poser with tinting and genetics
* C16/S16/BLK viewer
* Batch colour conversion to fix RGB555 sprites
