## RAL/CPX Installation Guide

// DIRECTION: If someone has a RAL source code file, they should be able to inject it.

First of all, the assumption is that you are receiving this file with _at least_ the following other files:

* `README.md`: Licenses, general description of things.
* `COPYING.txt`: Licenses.
* `caosproxy`: Directory.
** `caosprox.exe`: Contains the CAOS Proxy, used to connect RAL to the game.
* `ral`: Directory.
** `ral.jar`: Contains the RAL compiler.
** `ral`: For Linux and Mac OS X users.
** `ral.cmd`: For Windows users.
** `raljector`: RALjector launch.
** `raljector.cmd`: RALjector launch.
** `raltest`: RAL CPX test launch.
** `raltest.cmd`: RAL CPX test launch.

There are other necessary files, but this should give you an idea of what to look for.

### Java Installation

You need to install Java. Any Minecraft player who isn't playing the Bedrock versions has this, but it might not be globally installed, and if it's not globally installed it doesn't count.

Before you potentially waste time, open your local Terminal or Command Prompt or etc. and attempt the command `java -version`.

You should receive output that looks vaguely like this:

```
openjdk 17.0.4 2022-07-19
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.4+8-Ubuntu-122.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.4+8-Ubuntu-122.04, mixed mode, sharing)
```

_If you don't get an error and you have a Java version above or equal to 8, RAL will work and you can skip installing Java: You already have it._

At present, a good source is https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/ .

Some notes on Java installation:

* Install the JDK if you intend to develop Java applications, stick to the JRE otherwise.
** The JDK contains a JRE, so you don't need both.
* You _probably_ want the highest Java version, for other applications you might want to run other than RAL.
** There are exceptions to this rule for people curious about modded ancient versions of certain sandbox voxel games.
** RAL requires at least Java 8, but it isn't particularly picky about which Java version it runs on.
* If you are on Windows, you probably want the `.msi` version.
** For the Windows installer (`.msi`), installing to PATH is the default. You'd have to mess things up for it not to install to PATH.
** The `.zip` download requires you manually add it to your PATH.
* For Linux, you're better off grabbing a `java` package from your distribution.
** Remember, RAL doesn't require anything higher than Java 8. These days, that means literally any Java package you install from your distribution will be supported by RAL.
* For Mac OS X, please use the `.pkg` version -- I have a hunch it is more likely to install to PATH. (This is not tested.)

You _absolutely must ensure that a Java version is in your PATH._

You will know if Java is in your PATH as (_after possibly a logout and login_) the above `java --version` command will function.

### CPX (CAOS Proxy)

CPX, or the CAOS Proxy, or `caosprox.exe`, is a program which allows connecting programs to the game's shared-memory port that couldn't otherwise access it. Java is one of those languages.

_Important: The CAOS Proxy is not compatible with certain Windows firewall and antivirus products. If stuff goes wrong, you probably need to add an exclusion for the CAOS Proxy. It might be necessary to add an exclusion for Java, but please avoid this unless it actually does make stuff work, as RAL is not the only thing that uses Java._

Starting the CAOS Proxy is simple: Run `caosprox.exe`.

Linux users: Use Wine. (If you are using the Linux version of Docking Station, run `cpxciesv.py` instead.)

Mac OS X users: Use Wine, or start `caosprox.exe` in your virtual machine. If you are starting `caosprox.exe` in a virtual machine, and you wish to use RAL outside that virtual machine, then you may need to use `caosprox.exe loud 0.0.0.0`. _This will enable remote access to the CAOS Proxy, and should therefore only be done if you're sure servers hosted on the virtual machine can't be accessed outside of your system._ You will then need to set the `CPX_HOST` and `CPX_PORT` environment variables on the system you wish to run RAL from. _If you don't like this, stop using a system that went to a different processor architecture and broke support for stuff. There is nothing I can do to help you, so don't ask._

Stopping the CAOS Proxy can be done via the tray icon that appears in the bottom-right.

You can test RAL is functioning properly by running the provided `raltest` script.

Results should look something like this:

```
RAL Compiler
Standard Library Directory: /media/modus/Sync2/repositories/c3ds-projects/ral/include
include: std/compiler_helpers.ral
include: std/compiler_prelude.ral
include: std/cpx_connection_test.ral
CPX connection OK - connected to Docking Station
Engine version 2.286
Identified as Docking Station, Build 195.
Modules OriginalDisplay DirectX (sillymodule 1, netbabel 148)

Press Enter to continue...
```

If you don't see `CPX connection OK`, RAL was probably unable to connect to the CPX server.

_If you are connecting to Creatures 3, the script will not show the modules. This is because Creatures 3 uses an older version of the engine which doesn't have them._

### RALjector

You can start RALjector by simply running the RALjector launch script in some way.

This offers a mixture of a CAOS Debugger and CAOS Tool-like experience, although it doesn't include an editor.

### Editor Setup

Please skip to the Booklet of Tooling Pointers and check there in regards to the current state of editors that RAL has integration for.

If you need to setup something custom, RAL provides a Language Server Protocol server as the `ral lsp` command (using standard IO).

### Command-Line Use

The command-line `ral` tool is the best way to make release versions of RAL projects, as it can be used in batch scripts and so forth.

`RALjector` is also basically capable but is inconvenient.

_Please look into the `RAL Tooling Reference` for this._

### Things To Check

You are expected to be able to save the following RAL code as a file, inject it, and see the results:

```
include "std/c3ds.ral";

install {
    rtar(SpeechBubbleFactory);
	with SpeechBubbleFactory targ {
		targ->speechBubble("Golly, this is a speech bubble!", pntr());
	}
}
```
