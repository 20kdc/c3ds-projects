### Technical Details

#### Expressions

Expressions are represented as slices (`RALExprSlice`). Slices are made up of slots.

Slices may be subdivided, but if you do this then parts of the expression may be outright dropped, *including side-effects.*

This mechanism is necessary for feature like macros returning multiple values, and so forth.

*The answer in regards to how this interacts with macros, statement expressions and side-effects is that if you try to push it, you can probably find cases where a void macro will be sliced off, or an expression has to be executed twice to fulfill a particularly hare-brained request.*

*The following are [underline]##compiler guarantees##, so if the compiler violates these, it's a bug:*

1. A compiled read does not necessarily mean code will actually be generated, if the compiler determines that the read is sufficiently pointless. Where this applies is really case-specific and subject to change, but should always be kept within the realm of "blatantly stupid NOPs". Right now, the reading side determines this, and writing a VA to Discard counts (as neither Discard nor the VA can even theoretically have side effects).

2. An assignment statement will compile a read of the *root of the right-hand-side* expression. Initial values in a `let` statement count, and expression statements such as `1;` or `doTheThing();` count as assignment statements with discards on the left side.

3. Deliberately discarding values with `_` will generate uninitialized variables for the purpose. Therefore assignments to it will compile reads (unless they're otherwise broken).

4. Macro non-inline parameters will compile reads of the *root* expression. The same *does not* apply to `alias` or macro inline parameters -- these are aliases, not real variables.

5. An assignment statement will always compile the root expression, and a macro call (which for `someCall();` is the root expression) will always compile it's own root expression in turn.

6. When an expression is not the root, things get complicated -- for example, macro inline arguments don't even exist until they're actually used within the macro.

Note, however, no guarantees are made about when the compiler *will not* compile an expression's side-effects -- this is because macros with no return values and empty (and thus elidable) expression slices look very much the same.

There's a current rule in the compiler about writing single slots at a time, but this rule is potentially up for negotiation, which is why it's not included in the guarantees.

In addition, statement expressions have some interesting slicing rules meant to try and reduce the amount of nonsense that goes on around macros.

#### Conditions

Conditions are a special case of expressions. The reason they're special is because in most cases, the RAL compiler is able to directly embed a condition inside a CAOS conditional or loop.

Note, however, that due to this, logical operators may not use short-circuit evaluation like other languages do, so if side effects execute is at best situation-dependent.

This is important as RAL attempts to simulate more advanced boolean expression support within the framework of CAOS, which does not have advanced boolean expression support.

So idioms such as `(cat != null) && catCanMeow(cat)` will not act properly (`catCanMeow(cat)` may get executed regardless of if `cat` is `null`)

#### Lexer

The RAL lexer has 6 distinct token categories:

- ID

- Keyword

- String

- String Embedding (that is, string concatenation with *style*).

- Float

- Integer

However, in practice, there are only 5:

- ID/Keyword

- Operator (considered a keyword)

- String - starts with `"`

- String Embedding - starts with `'`, `{}` inside surrounds expressions (which are 'outside' of the string - it's complicated)

- Float/Integer - must start with a digit, `+`, or `-`,  and must contain at least one digit, `.`, or `e`.
  
  - The distinction between Float and Integer is based on Java's `Integer.parseInt` and `Float.parseFloat` functions.
    If the number parses as an integer, then that is what you get.
    Otherwise, if the number parses as a float, that's what you get.
    Otherwise, a compiler error is given.

#### Dirty CAOS Tricks

* RAL makes heavy use of `goto` and `subr` for loops so that `break;` is as simple as a `goto`.
* The ability to `break` from an `enum` is essentially magic code, relying on some aspects of how the CAOS VM handles the stack.
* RAL switches between the `ovXX`, `mvXX` and `avar` variables when doing field accesses, to avoid having to alter `targ` ever.

#### RAL's Minimum Requirements For Non-Standard CAOS Runtimes

The following are the minimum requirements when compiling RAL to a non-standard CAOS runtime. _These are CAOS features that will be used by RAL._

First and foremost, keep in mind `codeGenFeatureLevel customEngine;`.

This causes the codegen to assume the DS engine, but without the truly bad code:

- The "magic cleanup code" for enum breakout is not present.

The following CAOS features are required to be supported for RAL itself:

- `vaXX` is required for variables, including implicit temporaries RAL makes in the course of operation, and as debugger storage.

- `avar` and `ovXX` are required for field access.

  - If `codeGenFeatureLevel ds;` or better is used, `mvXX` is required (otherwise, it is emulated using `avar`).

- `seta`, `sets`, and `setv` are required for setting variables.

- `ownr`, `targ`, `from`, `_it_`, `_p1_`, `_p2_` and `null` are assumed to exist.

- `fmly`, `gnus` and `spcs` are used for the `instanceof` feature.

- `mesg wrt+` and `mesg writ` are used for emits.

- `call` is used for calls.

- The structure of the install script (without `iscr` marker), `scrp 1 2 3 4` ... `endm` blocks, and remove script (with `rscr` marker) is assumed to be supported.

- `doif`, `else` and `endi` are used for conditionals. All conditional syntax here is made use of. The `eq`-style syntax is used, not `=`/etc.

- `negv` / `notv` are used as appropriate.

- `goto` and `subr` are used for loops.

- `econ`, `enum`, `epas`, `esee`, `etch` have hard-coded stuff going on.

- `orrv`, `andv`, `subv`, `divv`, `mulv`, `adds`, and `vtos` are used in the "modify/assign statement" logic.
