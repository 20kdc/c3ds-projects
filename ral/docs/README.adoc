## Introduction

RAL is a statically typed language that compiles to CAOS. *(While "AL" can be reasonably assumed to be "Agent Language", the meaning of the R may yet come under heated debate in parlours of tea-drinking across the countryside - if they are sun-lit or not is a matter of timing, of course. Complicating this matter is the compiler's package name of `rals`, which does little to improve the situation. While theories have not yet reached the heights of "Real Agents Loath Shee", that time is probably coming, eventually.)*

The purpose of RAL is to allow for working on complex modding projects without having to worry about the typical problems that come with that in CAOS, such as keeping track of variable names by number.

RAL is split into a compiler (itself written in Java) and a standard library (__incomplete__) covering Creatures 3 and Docking Station.

As such, this manual is intended to be written in distinct sections:

* The *RAL/CPX Installation Guide* explains how to install RAL and CPX and ensure they are functioning properly.
* The *Crash Course On CAOS For New Users* is a quick introduction to how Creatures 3/Docking Station's CAOS programming language, to which RAL compiles, works. __This is essential reading to understand RAL if you are new to Creatures 3/Docking Station agent programming. In particular, most RAL documentation assumes you have a basic working knowledge of CAOS, and therefore concepts described here are treated as "obvious" elsewhere.__
* The *Vending Machine Tutorial* is for the more tutorial-oriented student, running through the creation of a set of agents: a coin, a fruit, and finally a vending machine using RAL. Course materials will be supplied.
* The *Booklet Of Tooling Pointers* points at tools that are typically paired with RAL to create a more complete agent development environment, along with how to install them.
* The *Tooling Reference* covers how to use the RAL compiler to compile RAL source code into CAOS, alongside other tasks.
* The *Language Reference* covers RAL as a language, and constructs universal to the compiler.
* The *Language Technical Details* cover scary technical bits of RAL - this may be important to look at if you're encountering something weird.
* The *Library Reference* covers RAL's standard library, which mainly consists of macros and constants describing Creatures 3/Docking Station.
