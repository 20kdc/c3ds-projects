## Booklet of Tooling Pointers

The following are various tools of relevance to use with RAL (for more tools, please just look at the Creatures Wiki):

### Editing

* lite-xl: https://lite-xl.com/
** Function: Very lightweight text editor, has LSP support with a plugin.
** Pros: If you already have the LSP client plugin installed, setup is two steps:
*** Step 1. Drop `language_ral.lua` into your plugins directory.
*** Step 2. Open your lite-xl config, paste in the contents of `syntax/litexl_config_snippet.lua` at the end, adjust until it works.
** Cons: Too mercurial. Needs to stabilize. The version I have is a tad crashy. Installing the LSP client plugin is a convoluted process due to version conflicts.
*** If there was a universal distribution of lite-xl with the LSP plugin that didn't crash, the RAL install process for lite-xl could be streamlined to just the part where you adjust the config.

* Kate: https://kate-editor.org/
** Function: Decently lightweight text editor with LSP support. (In a plugin, but said plugin is shipped with the base installation.)
** Pros: Works with RAL's LSP with relatively little configuration:
*** Step 1. Copy `syntax/kate/ral.xml` to the syntax highlighting files directory. See https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html for this -- if the link has broken, it's _probably_ `.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax` or `AppData/Local/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax`. The `.local/share` or `AppData/Local` part is expected to already exist, and the `org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax` part is expected to _not_ exist, so you will need to create it.
**** Alternatively, find your Kate installation, find the relevant directory _there_ where it stores all the built-in presets, and simply place the file there.
***** I won't tell Kate developers if you won't.
*** Step 2. Enable the LSP Client plugin, apply, and close the settings window.
*** Step 3. Re-open the settings, and in the LSP Client settings, in User Server Settings, copy in the contents of `syntax/kate/lsp.json` from your RAL distribution and adjust for the location of your RAL installation (and change `ral", "lsp` to `ral.cmd", "lsp` if on Windows)
*** _Optionally, you can use the External Tools plugin to create a shortcut to quickly start RALjector, along with the CAOS Proxy. How is left as an exercise for the reader._
** Cons: The RAL install process could be better. It is, however, infinitely better than dealing with Visual Studio Code, where implementing support for a language starts with, essentially, creating a whole separate project for the sole purpose of satisfying the VSC blood gods.

*Note that any _sensible_ LSP-compatible text editor can be used with RAL. Despite being the originator of the Language Server Protocol, VSCode is not sensible -- in particular, there is no way to simply allow a user to enable an LSP server the way you can in Kate.*

### Build/Conversion

#### Graphical

* SG's Spritist: https://github.com/zenzoa/spritist
** Function: Sprite converter.
** Pros: Nice UI.
** Cons: Considers your RAM sticks tasty delectable treats. Your hard disk, also. The sprite conversion can't dither.
* Jagent: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jagent/
** Function: PRAY compiler/decompiler, sprite converter.
** Pros: If you can run RAL, you can run this. Very small. Also acts as a command-line PRAY builder.
** Cons: The sprite conversion can't dither.

#### Command-Line

* openc2e 0.2: https://github.com/openc2e/openc2e/releases/tag/v0.2
** Function: Contains a PRAY compiler and decompiler.
** Pros: Doesn't require Wine (for Mac/Linux users) and it's convenient to have `praydumper` on-tap sometimes.
** Cons: None relating to the relevant functions here.
* libs16.py: Part of c3ds-projects, which you are reading a part of right now...
** Function: Sprite and background conversion.
** Pros: Can dither (if you ask it to).
** Cons: Awkward to use unless you put it in your PATH, sometimes buggy, always slow. Best used as part of a Makefile. Requires Python 3 and PIL installed.

### Debugging

// this won't accept RAL, but it's still got it's uses
* CAOS Tool: https://creatures.wiki/CAOS_Tool
** Function: Write CAOS, inject it, simple as that.
** Pros: Easier to work with than the CAOS Command Line.
** Cons: If it doesn't like the syntax, it won't bother sending it to the engine.
* CAOS Debugger: https://creatures.wiki/CAOS_Debugger
** Function: Keeping an eye on script execution in real-time.
** Pros: Can monitor all the various debug things.
** Cons: Buggy, crashy, and not the nicest to use.
