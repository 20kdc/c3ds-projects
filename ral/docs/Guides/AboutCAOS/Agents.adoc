## Crash Course On CAOS For New Users: Agents and Parts

*Agents* are the main kind of "thing" in Creatures 3 and Docking Station.

Agents have a _classifier_, made up of a family, genus, and species.

Classifiers have a hierarchy to them, based on substituting various fields with 0:

* `0 0 0`
** `1 0 0`
*** `1 2 0`
**** `1 2 3`

If a script isn't in a given classifier, the equivalent script from a parent classifier will be used (if there is a script there).

Things that are agents:

* Lemons.
* Norns.
* UI panels.
* The lemon vendor.
* Static foreground elements. (They need to be agents to have a plane other than simply "the far background".)

Things that are not agents:

* A button on the Comms screen. (This is a *part* of a compound agent.)
* In most cases, static background elements. (Not that they can't be agents, but they're usually part of the metaroom's background file.)

There are different kinds of agents, that will be documented below.

### Simple Agents

*Simple* agents are made up of a single sprite.

Created with `NEW: SIMP`.

### Compound Agents

*Compound* agents are made up of parts, where part 0 is the root part (created with the agent).

Each part has it's own sprite (or sprites).

The current part is selected using the `PART` command -- for example, `part 0` selects the root part. `PART` is similar to `TARG`, and in commands that manipulate parts, the two often must be used together.

An example of this:

```
targ va00 * select the target
part 2 * select part 2
pose 5 * set part 2's pose to 5
```

Note that the `targ` and `part` commands here need not be in this order. As long as `part` and `targ` have been set to the correct values by the time any command using them runs, it will work.

Created with `NEW: COMP`.

The different kinds of parts are:

#### Dull Part

*Dull* parts are additional sprites on a compound agent.

Created with `PAT: DULL`.

#### Button Part

*Button* parts are used for buttons.

Created with `PAT: BUTT`.

#### Text Part

*Text* parts are used for writable text fields.

Created with `PAT: TEXT`.

#### Fixed Text Part

*Fixed Text* parts are used for read-only text fields.

Created with `PAT: FIXD`.

#### Camera Part

A camera part shows a view elsewhere on the Map.

Created with `PAT: CMRA`.

#### Graph Part

A graph part shows a graph.

Created with `PAT: GRPH`.

### Vehicle Agents

*Vehicle* agents are Compound agents, but they have a cabin.

The cabin can be resized, and can store any number and type of other agents (unless configured to have a passenger limit).

Created with `NEW: VHCL`.

### Creatures

*Creature* agents are split into two kinds, Skeletal (aka `CREA`) and non-Skeletal (aka `CRAG`).

Skeletal creatures are the ones you know and want to pet. Few people particularly know or care about non-skeletal creatures.

For now, knowing how to create these isn't strictly critical knowledge, especially as the process is rather specific in any case (look at the egg CAOS, perhaps).
