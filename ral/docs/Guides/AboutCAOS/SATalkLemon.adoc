## Crash Course On CAOS For New Users: Scripts & A Talking Lemon

// DIRECTION: Still using the CAOS command line, on-road the user into making a talking lemon.
// Try to make the lemon stateful using MVs.
// Classifier allocated for this is 2 24 8802

Now that you know the basics of CAOS, it's time to move onto actually putting an agent into the world and giving it some behaviour. How?

### Putting The Lemon In The World

First, get ahold of a lemon. The Lemon Pod, located to the top-left of the Norn Meso, is a good source of them.

Second, we need to find out what the spritesheet name and starting frame are.

While the mouse is over a lemon...

```
> targ hots outs gall
ds lemon pod
> targ hots outv abba
30
```

_These don't change, but it's useful to know these exist nonetheless._

The first output is referring to `Docking Station/Images/ds lemon pod.c16`.

The second output is referring to frame 30 of that file.

Finally, we need to create the lemon.

You can use Control-Shift-X to show X and Y coordinates underneath the Hand.

This guide will use `631 9158` as the coordinates.

```
> new: simp 2 24 8802 "ds lemon pod" 1 30 8000
OK
```
This creates the "lemon" in the world, but a position has not been given.

```
> rtar 2 24 8802 mvsf 631 9158
OK
```

This selects the lemon using `rtar`, which sets `targ` to a random instance of classifier `2 24 8802` (of which there should only be one right now).

It then places it using `mvsf`, which places the lemon near the target coordinates, trying to avoid intersection with walls.

Rather than using `rtar 2 24 8802`, you can instead use `targ hots` while hovering the mouse over the lemon, but this is likely to cause accidents if you aim in the wrong place.

### Giving The Lemon Physics

```
> rtar 2 24 8802 perm 100 attr 199
OK
```

_If you instead receive "Invalid map location (..., ...)", consider moving the lemon to somewhere that is within the normal bounds of the game world._

The lemon should now slowly drop to the floor... and potentially start bouncing a lot.

```
> rtar 2 24 8802 aero 10 accg 2
OK
```

And that should make it stop bouncing.

### Making It Talk

Now that we have an agent that we want to do stuff to, let's try actually, well, doing something to it.

```
> rtar 1 2 10 mesg wrt+ targ 126 "Hello! I'm a talking lemon!" hots 0
OK
```

Breaking it down into it's constituent commands, we have:

* `rtar 1 2 10`: Selects the Speech Bubble Factory, an agent which produces speech bubbles.
* `mesg wrt+ targ 126 "Hello! I'm a talking lemon!" hots 0`: Sends message 126 "Make Speech Bubble" to the Speech Bubble Factory (as `targ`), with parameters `"Hello, I'm a talking lemon!"` (the text) and `hots` (the speaking agent, in this case whatever's under the pointer). Important to note is that everything after `mesg wrt+` is a valid expression.

### Attaching A Script

This is the part where what is arguably just a random object becomes a talking lemon.

```
> scrp 2 24 8802 1 rtar 1 2 10 mesg wrt+ targ 126 "Hello! I'm a talking lemon!" ownr 0 endm
OK
```

And now just click the lemon, and it will say its line.

Breaking this down into it's constituent components, we have:

* `scrp 2 24 8802 1`: This begins script 1 on classifer `2 24 8802`.
* `rtar 1 2 10`: Selects the Speech Bubble Factory, an agent which produces speech bubbles.
* `mesg wrt+ targ 126 "Hello! I'm a talking lemon!" ownr 0`: Sends message 126 "Make Speech Bubble" to the Speech Bubble Factory (as `targ`), with parameters `"Hello, I'm a talking lemon!"` (the text) and `ownr` (the speaking agent, in this case `ownr`).
* `endm`: This ends the script.

Some further notes:

* When a script is executing on an agent, `ownr` is the agent that the script is executing on.
* Script number 1 is also known as Activate 1.
* Scripts do not have to be defined in order.
* Script definitions are installed _before any other code in a CAOS file._
* Script definitions are installed to the world for any agent that matches the classifier -- i.e. if you were to follow the steps above to create this lemon again on the same world, it would already have the script.

### Past This Point, Use CAOS Tool!

Past this point you should install CAOS Tool if you have not already.

The examples have been given via CAOS Command Line so that you do not need additional tooling, but CAOS Command Line does not make a good development environment.

### Machine Variables (MVs)

### Conditionals

### Things To Check

* Make the lemon randomly say one of multiple lines.
* Use a Constructor script to set `perm`, `attr`, `aero`, and `accg` of a lemon.
** The Constructor script, script 10, is automatically run on creation of an agent.
