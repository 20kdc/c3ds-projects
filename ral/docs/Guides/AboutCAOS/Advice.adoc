## Crash Course On CAOS For New Users: A Final Bit Of Advice

// DIRECTION: Don't have infinite time to write all this.
// Point to other resources.

* If you don't know what a command or expression does, translate, say, `NEW: SIMP` into `newSimp` and check elsewhere in this manual.

* If this manual doesn't have anything, or you can't find it, or this manual sucks, get a copy of the CAOS Categorical And Alphabetical Documentation. You can generate it using CAOS Tool, _or_ via typing the following into the CAOS Command Line:

```
> file oope 1 "alphabetical.html" 0 dbg: html 0 file oclo
OK
> file oope 1 "categorical.html" 0 dbg: html 1 file oclo
OK
```

Then check your `Docking Station/Journal` directory.

* If that is not enough, start looking for other resources. There's been 20 years of research, _someone_ probably wrote _something_ about what you're looking for information on.
