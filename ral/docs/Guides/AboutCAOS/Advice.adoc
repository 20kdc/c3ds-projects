### A Final Bit Of Advice

_shouldn't be bound to the spine_

// DIRECTION: Don't have infinite time to write all this.
// Point to other resources.

#### Packaging CAOS For `.agents` Files

This is a very quick part, as other resources exist for this, but:

* 1. Get a PRAY compiler. (See the "Booklet Of Tooling Pointers" section.)
* 2. Modify this template:

```
"en-GB"

(- The "Example Docking Station Agent" name is what will show up in-game in Docking Station. -)
group DSAG "Example Docking Station Agent"
(- Type of agent. This is required for injection, but it's not really meaningful. -)
"Agent Type" 0
(- The file the sprite is from (automatically installed like Dependency lines to show the icon) -)
"Agent Animation File" "example_agent_sprite.c16"
(- Sprite as you would pass to NEW: SIMP or such. -)
"Agent Animation Gallery" "example_agent_sprite"
(- Animation as in ANMS command. -)
"Agent Animation String" "0"
"Agent Description" "This text describes the agent in the Agent Injector."

(- The number of dependencies. -)
"Dependency Count" 2

(-
    Dependencies must be numbered from 1 onwards.
    Categories indicate where to install the file:
    1: Sounds
    2: Images
    3: Genetics
    4: Body Data
    5: Overlays
    6: Backgrounds
    7: Catalogue
    10: My Creatures
    11: My Agents
-)

"Dependency 1" "example_agent_sprite.c16"
"Dependency Category 1" 2

"Dependency 2" "example_agent_catalogue.catalogue"
"Dependency Category 2" 7

(- The number of scripts. -)

"Script Count" 1

(- The first script. -)
"Script 1" @ "example_agent.cos"

(- The remove script. There's only one. Note that this is run as if it was an install script, so this should not be put into an rscr block or anything. -)
"Remove script" @ "example_agent_del.cos"

(- These lines embed files into the .agents file. -)
(- If the files are not embedded, then if the user doesn't have them, the agent will not be injected. -)

inline FILE "example_agent_sprite.c16" "example_agent_sprite.c16"

inline FILE "example_agent_catalogue.catalogue" "example_agent_catalogue.catalogue"
```

Hopefully that's enough.

#### Command / Expression References

* If you don't know what a command or expression does, translate, say, `NEW: SIMP` into `newSimp` and check elsewhere in this manual.

* If this manual doesn't have anything, or you can't find it, or this manual sucks, get a copy of the CAOS Categorical And Alphabetical Documentation. You can generate it using CAOS Tool, _or_ via typing the following into the CAOS Command Line:

```
> file oope 1 "alphabetical.html" 0 dbg: html 0 file oclo
OK
> file oope 1 "categorical.html" 0 dbg: html 1 file oclo
OK
```

Then check your `Docking Station/Journal` directory.

* If that is not enough, start looking for other resources. There's been 20 years of research, _someone_ probably wrote _something_ about what you're looking for information on.
