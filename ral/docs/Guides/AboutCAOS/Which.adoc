### What CAOS, and Which?

_will the real CAOS please stand up?_

CAOS is a programming language used by the Creatures series of games.

It comes in three iterations for the three main Creatures games: Creatures 1 CAOS, Creatures 2 CAOS, and Creatures 3 CAOS.

However, RAL only targets Creatures 3/Docking Station CAOS, so that is what will be covered here.

There is a good reason for this: Firstly, the different CAOS versions are mostly incompatible with each other and secondly, there are major limitations to early CAOS.

#### The Limitations Of Early CAOS

Creatures 1 CAOS:

* Effectively doesn't have strings (they cannot be stored or manipulated).
* Agents can store exactly one agent reference each, `OBJP`. (Not even enough for LISP-style linked lists...)
* Agents can store 3 integer variables each, `OBV0`, `OBV1`, and `OBV2`.
* There are 10 script variables, `VAR0` through `VAR9`.
* Classifier numbers and script numbers are 8-bit (0-255) -- collisions are likely.
* There is no `GOTO` (To explain, RAL uses `GOTO` to implement workarounds for missing CAOS features.)
* Above all else, this iteration of CAOS is simply meant as a way to give unique-ish behaviours to simple objects. Even if complex computations were done in it, they don't provide a utility to the end user.

_Simply put, C1 CAOS is not really salvagable as a basis for a general programming language._

Creatures 2, meanwhile:

* Still doesn't have strings.
* Has 100 object variables, as `OV00` through `OV99`.
* Can actually store agent references in them now.
* Also has 100 script variables, as `VA00` through `VA99`.
* Still no `GOTO`.
* The species and script number components have been bumped up to 16-bit.
* CAOS is still playing second fiddle to hard-coded game logic. Hence, "Blackboard Objects", "Lift Objects", "Call Button Objects"...

_C2 CAOS might be salvagable, but RAL would suffer in functionality if it attempted to support C2._

Creatures 3:

* Has strings and string manipulation functions.
* Variables can store agents, strings, floats, and integers.
* Has `GOTO`.
* Above all else, as all in-game UI is written in CAOS, CAOS by necessity had to be given the power to actually perform at least some of the logic that in-game UI requires. In practice, this lead to a great expansion in what CAOS can be used for.

#### Modern CAOS, and why you need to know about CAOS anyway

Creatures 3's CAOS, inside, resembles modern game scripting languages such as Lua, though it has its differences (for those interested: the "coroutines" are tied directly into agents, no garbage collection).

The main thing one can say about Creatures 3 CAOS is that a good language was within their grasp, but they either did not understand what they had or had a lack of context.

Part of RAL's goal relies on the distinction between the CAOS language's written form (i.e. what someone writing code in CAOS types to achieve a certain goal), and the capabilities available to it (what someone experienced with CAOS can make CAOS do).

RAL code, ultimately, is turned into CAOS code, and RAL design decisions are based on that premise -- therefore, to understand RAL, you must understand CAOS.
