### Animated Falling Lemons

_not to be confused with animated falling apples_

This is the final stage. The products are being managed and replenish, the random button is mostly kind of fair, and you can run out of stuff.

Now things just need a nice(ish) animation.

```
include::../../../samples/vending-machine-root-final.ral[]
```

#### Things To Check

* Adjust the animation. (Maybe add a little bounce?)
** Remember that you can re-inject event scripts.
* While this requires some spritework, consider adding more products.
** What needs to be changed in the code to add more products?
** Could the layout be setup with a "display hole" and a "next" button to make adding more products easier?
** Remove the explicit selection buttons in favour of only selecting products by random chance, and then adding as many products as one wishes?
