### Debugging With RALjector

RALjector is one of the more "value-added" parts of RAL. Theoretically, RAL can be operated entirely without RALjector. However, RAL intends to provide a better experience than CAOS, and RALjector is a part of that.

If you don't know how to start RALjector, then one of two things have occurred:

* You can't start RAL at all, and need to read the RAL Installation Guide.
* You can start RAL, but don't know how to start RALjector (it's the launch scripts directly next to the RAL launch scripts, but called `raljector`).

RALjector has a button at the top marked `File:`. This is the button you use to pick the RAL file you wish to inject or remove.

Pressing this and selecting the RAL file you wish to inject, you can then inject various scripts as CAOS Tool would.

_Notably, RALjector reloads all involved RAL files every time you perform an inject of any kind. This ensures you can use RALjector alongside your editor._

In this case, a good idea would be to first ensure Debug Info is _on_, then use `Inject Install/Events` as usual.

Now you can open the debugger.

You may need to fix some splitters (please don't panic, these ones don't crash to my knowledge).

To the bottom-right is the RALjector Debug Console. In practice, the only time you'll want to use this is to add or remove breakpoints.

Here, we want to run `bp+ 2 24 8803 1000` (type it and press Enter).

If you've been following along so far, you know `2 24 8803` is the `VendingMachine` classifier, and `1000` is the `buttonLemon` script number.

As such, this sets a breakpoint at the start of the buttonLemon script, which will freeze the game and open the debugger when reached.

Then, press the lemon button.

(If you only see `dbg: tack ownr @sndc "beep"` here, this means debug information wasn't on. Press Continue, Remove, Debug Info, Inject Install/Events, and re-enter the command.)

You should see the dummy script, with a red-backgrounded `@` to the left of the `sndc("beep");` command.

To the top-right, there are the frames.

* The `sounds.ral` frame is part of the RAL Standard Library.
* The `vending-machine-dummy.ral` frame is where the call to `sndc` is.
* The `CAOS` frame gives no detail, but shows the raw CAOS.

You can control which frame is default with the `filterLib` debug command (see `help`).

The breakpoint can be removed with `bp- 2 24 8803 1000`.

As for the buttons at the top-left:

* `step` advances a single CAOS line (though will skip multiple if it chances upon the debug metadata lines used by RALjector).
* `over` skips until the stack frame you have showing has changed. This can be used to skip past a complex function call, but it also tends to skip over any block of code.
* `stmt` skips until it _reaches_ the next debug metadata line, then skips that, too, so should roughly skip a single RAL statement in most cases.
* `continue` is directly equivalent to `dbg: play`, and simply continues the game until the next breakpoint is hit (or some other thing happens to interrupt the game).

RALjector also contains it's own somewhat limited CAOS command line, in the form of being able to use, say, `caos outs "Hello World!"` at the debug console.

However, RALjector does not split up CAOS the way CAOS Tool and the CAOS Command Line do, so the `scrp` block divider is not functional.

#### Things To Check

* If you write some RAL code into a copy of the dummy vending machine script, you should be able to step through it using a breakpoint. Note that RAL variable names automatically replace the variable names in the bottom-left panel when in the relevant stack frames.
* It is possible to step through the `init` script this way, and might be an idea to do so.
** It is even more interesting to step through with the CAOS frame, as this gives an idea of how RAL turns RAL code into CAOS, particularly the way that macros are flattened.
