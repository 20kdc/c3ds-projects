### From CAOS To RAL

// DIRECTION: Start dissecting the parts of the converted Talking Lemon.

Converting code from CAOS to RAL can be a relatively simple process or a relatively weird process.

When we left off, our CAOS code looked like this:

```
include::../AboutCAOS/TalkingLemonCTHead.cos[]
include::../AboutCAOS/TalkingLemonScriptFinal.cos[]
include::../AboutCAOS/TalkingLemonCTFooter.cos[]
```

A very literal transliteration to RAL goes as follows:

```
include::../../../samples/talking-lemon-naive.ral[]
```

So far, this code is clearly worse than what we started with.
However, this is the most straightforward translation from CAOS to RAL.

The first concepts we have to learn when translating to RAL are:

* RAL requires explicit sections for each script: `install`, `remove`, and `script TalkingLemon 1`. The code in scripts is surrounded by `{}`, rather than using `endm`.
** This will make sense shortly.
* RAL requires you to explicitly name the classifiers of scripts.
** This will make a lot more sense shortly.
* You can write a CAOS command inline by prefixing it with `&'` and ending with `';`.
* You need to explicitly reserve and name any variable you wish to use using `let`.
** Right now, we're explicitly reserving `va00`. However, you don't _have_ to do this, as we'll see in the next section.

#### Fields, Variables, And Conditions

RAL has it's own syntax for fields, variables, and conditions.

This syntax completely removes the need to manually allocate VA slots, and helps with OV slots.

```
/*
field TYPE CLASS.NAME SLOT;
The 0 here indicates ov00.
*/
field int TalkingLemon.line 0;

script TalkingLemon 1 {
	&'lock';
	// RAL automatically assigns the variable number.
	let str text;
	// if (CONDITION) STATEMENT [else STATEMENT]
	if (ownr.line == 0) {
		// Assignment: EXPRESSION = EXPRESSION;
		text = "Hello! I'm a talking lemon!";
		// Field access: EXPRESSION.FIELD
		ownr.line = 2;
		&'wait 15';
		ownr.line = 1;
	} else if (ownr.line == 1) {
		text = "Oh no, not again...";
		ownr.line = 2;
		&'wait 15';
		ownr.line = 0;
	} else {
		text = "You ought not to see this...";
		ownr.line = 0;
	}
	&'rtar 1 2 10';
	// The same {} wrapping that helps with literal strings is also able to translate variable names into the variables they represent.
	&'mesg wrt+ targ 126 {text} ownr 0';
}
```

#### foreach

The remove script can be improved as well.

`foreach` is the RAL equivalent to `enum`.

It still puts the result in `targ`, but it allows for the `break;` statement (leaving the loop early).

`foreach` can be used with a type (in which case, the classifier is lifted from that type), or with an explicit classifier. But for now we'll just use it with a type.

```
remove {
	// Delete all talking lemons
	// foreach (TYPE in enum[ EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION]) STATEMENT
	// foreach (TYPE in esee[ EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION]) STATEMENT
	// foreach (TYPE in etch[ EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION]) STATEMENT
	// foreach (TYPE in epas[ EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION]) STATEMENT
	// foreach (TYPE in econ EXPRESSION) STATEMENT
	foreach (TalkingLemon in enum) {
		&'kill targ';
	}
	// Remove the script
	&'scrx 2 24 8802 1';
}
```

#### The RAL Standard Library

The RAL Standard Library contains RAL definitions for many CAOS commands and expressions.

As such, finishing the conversion, the result is much cleaner.

```
include::../../../samples/talking-lemon-stdlib.ral[]
```

#### Constructor Script, Interface File

There's some final adjustments that can be made before moving onto other agents.

Mainly this amounts to preparations for later.

`talking-lemon-finished-interface.ral`:
```
include::../../../samples/talking-lemon-finished-interface.ral[]
```

`talking-lemon-finished.ral`:
```
include::../../../samples/talking-lemon-finished.ral[]
```

With the constructor script in place, the Talking Lemon is now more or less done.

#### Things To Check

* Check that you can actually inject the lemon with RALjector. If you can't, you probably need to check one of the following:
** The error (perhaps the interface and finished file are not in the same directory or have been copied incorrectly).
** The RAL Installation Guide (in case you can't start RALjector).
* A good idea is to make the lemon say a random line from a set of lines, without repeating the same line twice in a row.
* Note that while the Talking Lemon has been given an interface file as an example to help agents interface with each other, the next sections won't be using it (in favour of a regular Docking Station lemon).
