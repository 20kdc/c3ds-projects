### Types: What, why, how?

So you may have noticed four instances so far of the use of _types_ in RAL.

* `field *int* *TalkingLemon*.line 0;`
* `script *TalkingLemon*:act1 {`
* `let *str* text;`
* `(targ!*SpeechBubbleFactory*)`

You might be wondering why RAL requires you to have types, when CAOS does not.

The answer is simple: Having types allows for more contextual information, which helps prevent mistakes.

Small examples of this are in CAOS (and this is partially responsible for why it is not possible to simply remove types from RAL).

However, there are a number of specific ways in which this occurs.

#### CAOS Types

So the following line has an interesting property:
```
sets va00 va01
```

This line implicitly requires that the user know the type of `va01` is a string.

There is no single command in CAOS that copies a value from one variable to another (like `va01` to `va00` here) without knowing the CAOS type (number, string, agent reference).

Because of this, RAL needs to know the CAOS type of anything that RAL is writing into a CAOS variable. As such, RAL keeps track of the CAOS type of any given RAL type.

#### Bad Use Of Variable Types

Take the following CAOS code for instance:

```
* Do something funny
sets va00 "6"
outv va00
```

Note that before the code is actually run:

* `sets` is receiving the type it asked for, and so it is valid CAOS.
* `outv` cannot predict the value of `va00`, so it is valid CAOS.

_But in combination, the two commands will in fact produce a runtime error._

Now let us attempt this in RAL.

```
include::../../../samples/manual-types-error-example.ral[]
```

Attempting to View CAOS in RALjector will give you this result:

```
Compile errors:
manual-types-error-example.ral:5,(2 .. 2): Cannot cast str to int|float
```

Simply put, RAL will not allow `outv(x);` on a string.

There are, of course, ways to override this.

The cast suffix, `!` (followed by a type) gives the intent that while RAL may believe the value to be of one type, it is in fact another.

It is ideal to avoid casts, but due to the type of `targ` changing a lot, avoiding casts is not really reasonable.

As such, if you really wanted to produce a runtime error this way, you could use `outv(x!num);` or so forth.

#### Fields And Messages

Another useful attribute of types is when it comes to agents.

There are many kinds of agent, but as far as CAOS types go, they are one-size-fits-all.
Despite the many ways in which a `null` agent reference can cause an error, agent references that can contain `null` are identical to places which cannot.

In addition, which fields exist on an agent is specific to the classifier of that agent.

The first part of this problem is solved by RAL having nullable types. `Agent?`, also known as `Agent | null`, is a type that may be Agent or may be null.

The second part of this problem is solved by fields being declared on specific agent types, and RAL only accepting fields which exist on a given agent.

Messages, as used in `mesgWrit`, or via the emit syntax `RECV\->MESSAGE([P1[, P2]]) [after TICKS]`, can also be agent-dependent. The solution here is identical to that of fields.

#### Completion

Types allow tooling around RAL, such as the RAL Language Server, to provide accurate information about specific fields and messages when requested.

This information is built up out of the structure formed by the previous elements.

#### Inconsistent CAOS Behaviour

CAOS can do very weird things depending on the specific types involved in a calculation.

In particular, CAOS will use integer division if and only if both parameters are integers. If either is a float, the result is a float and uses floating-point division. This can change the result severely.

#### What are the built-in types?

Built-in Types:

* `int`: Integer, like `1` or `-2` or `0`.
* `float`: Float, like `1.0` or `-2.0` or `0` or `3.14159`.
* `bool`: Boolean (can be written to `int`)
* `str`: String, like `"Hello world!"`
* `Agent`: Classifier `0 0 0`, which covers all agents.
* `null`: Type specific to `null`.
* `any`: Unknown type. Cannot be stored without casting.

Built-in Union Types (Unions are types that can be more than one actual type at runtime):

* `num`: `float | int` (can be either)
* `Agent?`: `Agent | null` (the `?` suffix works in most, but not all, places types can be specified)

Note that the following implicit casts (casts you do not have to write, as the new type is considered as containing the previous type) apply:

* Any type that is a member of a union can be implicitly cast to that union.
* Any union such that every member in it can be implicitly cast to a second union may be implicitly cast to that second union.
* `bool` can be implicitly cast to `int` (and thus `num`).
* Any type can be implicitly cast to `any`, but storing it gets complicated and may require explicit casts. It's possible to have a variable of type `any`, but it is complicated to transfer values from it to somewhere else.
