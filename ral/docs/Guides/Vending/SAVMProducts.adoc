### Product Trays

_usually seen dispensing choccy_

This is where the vending machine really starts to manage it's products.

Again, we'll be splitting the code into a separate file for reuse.

`vending-machine-products.ral`:
```
include::../../../samples/vending-machine-products.ral[]
```

#### The Injectable File Itself

This, on the other hand, is a simple implementation of `dispenseProduct` which does the bare minimum.

```
include::../../../samples/vending-machine-root-products.ral[]
```

#### Things To Check

* If you want to skip the next chapter entirely, try making the product dispense sequence more involved.
** Remember that you can re-inject event scripts.
* While this requires some spritework, consider adding more products.
** What needs to be changed in the code to add more products?
** Could the layout be setup with a "display hole" and a "next" button to make adding more products easier?
** Remove the explicit selection buttons in favour of only selecting products by random chance, and then adding as many products as one wishes?
