## The Appendix

This is for assorted notes on things you probably didn't need to know.

### The After-Shee Date System

The After-Shee date system, revealed in Creature History by setting GAME variable `c3_after_shee_dates` to 1, is the underlying basis of the day and season cycle.

Each day is 20 minutes long, paused when the game is paused, not running, etc.

These 20 minutes are equally divided into 4-minute chunks, each one being a time of day:

* Dawn (0)
* Morning (1)
* Afternoon (2)
* Evening (3)
* Night (4)

Every 4 days makes up a season.

There are four seasons:

* Spring (0)
* Summer (1)
* Autumn (2)
* Winter (3)

Creatures 3 canonically starts at `1 Spr 127` (but this is considered to be `year` 0 -- add 127 to get the canon year).

### Where Networking Stuff Goes

Any and all networking-related documentation is part of Tower Of Babel.

And as for server software and the maintenance thereof, that's Natsue.

Please see the repository, as these aren't shipped in releases.

### What Are Stimulus Numbers For?

Stimulus numbers exist so that genetics can define the relation between objects and creature experiences.

For example this is how Toxic Norns can... exist in any sense, really.

Rather than an object directly specifying an effect, the object uses a stimulus number to specify what kind of object it is and what it's doing relative to the creature, and then the genetics can control how that affects the creature.
