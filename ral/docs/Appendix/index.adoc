## The Appendix

_it's not vestigial, honest!_

This is for assorted notes on things you probably didn't need to know.

### The After-Shee Date System

_creatures 3: invisible lore_

The After-Shee date system, revealed in Creature History by setting GAME variable `c3_after_shee_dates` to 1, is the underlying basis of the day and season cycle.

Each day is 20 minutes long, paused when the game is paused, not running, etc.

These 20 minutes are equally divided into 4-minute chunks, each one being a time of day:

* Dawn (0)
* Morning (1)
* Afternoon (2)
* Evening (3)
* Night (4)

Every 4 days makes up a season.

There are four seasons:

* Spring (0)
* Summer (1)
* Autumn (2)
* Winter (3)

Creatures 3 canonically starts at `1 Spr 127` (but this is considered to be `year` 0 -- add 127 to get the canon year).

### Where Networking Stuff Goes

Any and all networking-related documentation is part of Tower Of Babel.

And as for server software and the maintenance thereof, that's Natsue.

Please see the repository, as these aren't shipped in releases.

### What Are Stimulus Numbers For?

Stimulus numbers exist so that genetics can define the relation between objects and creature experiences.

For example this is how Toxic Norns can... exist in any sense, really.

Rather than an object directly specifying an effect, the object uses a stimulus number to specify what kind of object it is and what it's doing relative to the creature, and then the genetics can control how that affects the creature.

### CAOS Debug Information Format

RAL can embed debug information into scripts using commands such as:

```
sets va99 "H4sIAAAAAAAA/8WNwQ3CMAwAd/E7xZR+UNZgAisxYEicyAmVUNXdyZMJ4HfSSXcbVDLWDn77onAno9DZwJ8dXCUxeMDMUQhzia+Gl7eGExrX0qQXE24YltimauXBoTc0Stgo1zRMp/QUvU2Jc9FJSVY+DA8OkuhIL7v783L+wXI+7h/g/8/UbgEAAA=="
```

The presence of the command itself in the CAOS source is _not_ used for the debug information (but the sequence `sets va99 "` is used as a heuristic to skip these commands).

What is used is specifically the content of `va99` as read using the debug functionality.

The contents can be extracted by decoding the content as Base64 and then decompressing the GZip blob inside.

The results of this are the following (this has been formatted for your viewing convenience):

```
{
 "parent": {
  "parent": {
   "character": 8,
   "file": "/media/modus/Sync2/repositories/c3ds-projects/ral/samples/talking-lemon-naive.ral",
   "line": 3
  },
  "character": 8,
  "file": "/media/modus/Sync2/repositories/c3ds-projects/ral/samples/talking-lemon-naive.ral",
  "line": 3
 },
 "character": 1,
 "file": "/media/modus/Sync2/repositories/c3ds-projects/ral/samples/talking-lemon-naive.ral",
 "line": 10
}
```

A frame is made up of the following elements:

* `file`: The absolute file path.
* `character`: The character number on the line (as per LSP).
* `line`: The line number (as per LSP).
* `parent`: Optional: The parent frame
* `va00` through `va99`: Optional: Names of local variables. Specifying variables is optional on a per-variable basis.

_Importantly, RALjector will accept any debug information supplied in the correct place and format if the file exists._

_Also importantly, debug information is specific to the user writing the debug information._

_Even more importantly, the CAOS lexer is in danger of crashing if a constant string contains over 519 bytes, escapes counting as only one byte. If this risk becomes relevant, RAL will remove outer debug frames until it fits._
