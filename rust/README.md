# Stuff Written In Rust

Since Rust licensing is a complicated situation I don't want to try my hand at ([rust#67014](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67014)), and external crates are used here which will make it harder, binaries aren't going to enter releases. Sorry!

But the upside is, compiling Rust crates is easy!
